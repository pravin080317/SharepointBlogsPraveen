## Introduction:

<small>In this blog, we will discuss a Python code that extracts data from an Excel file stored on a SharePoint site using Azure AD app credentials. The code uses various Python libraries, including pandas, pyodbc, sqlalchemy, openai, and requests. The code takes a natural language input from the user and converts it into a SQL query, which is then used to extract data from the Excel file.</small>

### Libraries Used:
<small>
The code imports the following Python libraries:

json
logging
pandas
openai
pyodbc
sqlalchemy
office365
requests
io
base64
openpyxl</small>

### Azure AD App Credentials:
<small>
The code starts by defining the Azure AD app credentials. These credentials include the tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. The code uses these credentials to authenticate the app and get an access token to access the SharePoint site.</small>

### SharePoint Site and File Information:

<small>The code defines the SharePoint site URL and the library and file name to access the Excel file. It also defines the server-relative URL and file URL to get the Excel file content.
</small>
### Reading Excel File Content:

<small>The code uses the requests library to get the file content as bytes from the SharePoint site. It then uses the pandas library to read the Excel file content as a dataframe. The code creates an in-memory SQLite database and saves the dataframe to the database using the to_sql() method.</small>

### Converting Data to SQL Database:

<small>The code uses the SQLAlchemy library to create a connection to the in-memory SQLite database. It then executes the SQL query generated by OpenAI on the database and fetches the result as a list of dictionaries. The code uses the json library to convert the list of dictionaries to JSON format.</small>

### Using OpenAI to Generate SQL Query:

<small>The code uses the OpenAI API to generate an SQL query from the natural language input provided by the user. It formats the input as a system prompt and a user prompt and sends it to the OpenAI API to get a response. The code extracts the SQL query from the response and executes it on the database.</small>

### Extracting Data Using SQL Query:

<small>The code executes the SQL query generated by OpenAI on the in-memory SQLite database and fetches the result as a list of dictionaries. It then converts the list of dictionaries to JSON format and returns it as an HTTP response.</small>

### Possible Use Cases:

<small>This code can be used in various healthcare applications that store patient data in Excel files. The code can extract patient data based on natural language queries from healthcare providers, researchers, or administrators.</small>

### Possible Business Integrations:

### This code can be integrated with various healthcare applications that store patient data in Excel files. The code can be integrated with electronic health record (EHR) systems, health information exchanges (HIEs), or data analytics platforms.

### Possible Issues and Solutions about Management:

<small>The code uses Azure AD app credentials to authenticate the app and get an access token to access the SharePoint site. The app credentials need to be securely stored and managed to prevent unauthorized access. The code also uses OpenAI to generate SQL queries, which may not always provide accurate or secure results. It is recommended to review the SQL queries generated by OpenAI before executing them on the database.</small>

## Conclusion:

<small>In this blog, we discussed a Python code that extracts data from an Excel file stored on a SharePoint site using Azure AD app credentials. The code uses various Python libraries and takes a natural language input from the user and converts it into a SQL query, which is then used to extract data from the Excel file. The code can be used in various healthcare applications to extract patient data based on natural language queries. The code can be integrated with EHR systems, HIEs, or data analytics platforms. The app credentials need to be securely stored and managed, and the SQL queries generated by OpenAI need to be reviewed before execution. Overall, this code demonstrates the power of natural language processing and its potential applications in the healthcare industry.</small>
